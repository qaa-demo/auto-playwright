# **GenAI Playwright Demo ðŸ¤–**

Generate Playwright Tests ðŸŽ­ using Azure OpenAI

## Description
1. **Configure System Prompt**: Set up the system prompt to instruct the model to act as a Playwright Code Generator, providing the rules and expected output examples.

2. **Configure User Prompt**: Define the user prompt to generate test steps.

3. **Send Request**: Send the request to Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 model using the prompts to generate Playwright test code.

4. **Parse Response**: Parse the response and save it as a Playwright test.

5. **Trigger Test Execution**: Execute the test as a regular Playwright test.

6. **View Results**: View the Playwright execution results using the `npx playwright show-report` command as usual.


## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code
- An Azure subscription
- Azure OpenAI service in the Azure subscription
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with either the `gpt-35-turbo` or the `gpt-4` models deployed
- More Details: [Azure OpenAI Prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Cpython-new&pivots=programming-language-javascript#prerequisites)


## Description
- Prompt OpenAI to generate Playwright Test code based on instructions and test steps
- Parse OpenAI generated response and save it into Playwright Test file in `/tests/` folder
- Run generated Playwright test from the program automatically with `npm test` command
- View Execution Results, launch results with `npx playwright show-report` command

- Clone this repo to your local machine
- Open the repo project in VSCode, open new Terminal Window
- Run `npm install` command to install dependancies
- Run `npm i --save-dev @playwright/test` command to install latest version of Playwright
- Run project with the command: `node PlaywrightTestGenAI.js`
- View Console for execution log, wait for completion, it may take a few seconds (up to a minute)
- Playwright test will launch automatically
- Once completed, view Playwright test results by running the command: `npx playwright show-report`

Good luck! ðŸš€ ðŸ¤ž

## Notes:
- During the execution new test file will be generated i.e. `genai-test-2404231521.spec.js`
- Any previously generated files starting with **genai-test** will be backed up in `/tests-bkp` folder
- Each run generates new test file and backs up the previous file to `/tests-bkp` folder
