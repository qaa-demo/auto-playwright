# GenAI Playwright Demo :robot:

Generate Playwright Tests using  Azure OpenAI, 'Completions' 

In Azure OpenAI, 'Completions' refer to the response generated by the model when it completes a prompt. When you send a prompt to an Azure OpenAI model, it processes the prompt and generates a completion, which is the model's response or output based on the input it received.

## Description

- Prompt OpenAI to generate Playwright Test code based on instructions and test steps

- Parse OpenAI generated response and save it into Playwright Test file in `/tests/` folder

- Run generated Playwright test from the program automatically with `npm test` command

- View Execution Results, launch results with `npx playwright show-report`command

## Notes:
- During the execution new test file will be generated i.e. `genai-test-2404231521.spec.js`
- Previously generated file will be backed up in `/tests-bkp` folder
- Each run generates new test file and backs up the previous file to `/tests-bk`p` folder
