- Run project with the command: `node PlaywrightTestGenAI.js`
- View Console for execution log, wait for completion, it may take a few seconds (up to a minute)
- Playwright test will launch automatically
- Once completed, view Playwright test results by running the command: `npx playwright show-report`

Good luck! ðŸš€ ðŸ¤ž

## Notes:
- During the execution new test file will be generated i.e. `genai-test-2404231521.spec.js`
- Any previously generated files starting with **genai-test** will be backed up in `/tests-bkp` folder
- Each run generates new test file and backs up the previous file to `/tests-bkp` folder
